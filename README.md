# System Directory for Individual part

The `system` directory is the central application assembly point for this monorepo project. It is responsible for bringing together the individual feature systems developed in the `packages` directory and the shared components and utilities from the group packages (`ui-components`, `utils`) to form the complete application.

According to the project instructions, "Configuration and Assembly only is allowed on System directory."

## Structure

This directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- **`app/`**: Contains the main application entry point (`App.jsx`) where feature components are imported and composed.
- **`config/`**: Holds application-wide configuration files (e.g., API endpoints, constants).
- **`routing/`**: Defines the application's navigation structure and routes using a library like `react-router-dom`.
- **`store/`**: Sets up global state management (e.g., using React Context or Redux) for sharing data across features.
- **`themes/`**: Manages the application's visual theme and provides theme access to components.
- **`utils/`**: Can contain system-level utility functions, though common utilities are often in a dedicated group `utils` package.
- **`index.jsx`**: The primary JavaScript/JSX entry point for the build tool (Vite in this case), which typically renders the main `App` component.

## Role in the Monorepo

The `system` directory is where the independent pieces of the monorepo are orchestrated into a single application. It handles:

- **Feature Composition:** Importing and arranging the top-level components of individual features.
- **Application-wide Configuration:** Providing access to shared settings.
- **Navigation:** Defining how users move between different parts of the application.
- **Global State:** Managing state that needs to be accessible by multiple features.
- **Integration:** Connecting the core application logic with the shared UI components and utilities.

By keeping assembly and configuration separate from the feature implementations, the `system` directory helps maintain modularity and clarity in the monorepo structure.

## Running the Application

To run the the Individual part, which is configured and assembled within this `system` directory, you should use the development script defined at the **root** of the monorepo.

1. Navigate to the root directory of the monorepo (`~/monorepoProject`).
2. Run the development server using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the Vite development server and serve the application configured in the `system` directory. You can then access the application in your web browser.

Individual feature packages (`packages/feature-x`, `packages/feature-y`, etc.) might have their own specific scripts for running in isolation during development, but the primary way to run the integrated application is from the monorepo root.
